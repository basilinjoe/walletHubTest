<div class="">

  <p>5) Have a directive that is dependent of ngModel, that restricts the input to numbers only and auto formats the input as a phone number like (541) 754-3010 . The field must change its format as user types. Do not create a $filter for this
    directive as that does not mean the directive itself is doing the format.</p>

  <input class="form-control" type="text" ng-model="phone" phone-input>
  <p>NgModel Value :
    {{phone}}
  </p>
</div>
