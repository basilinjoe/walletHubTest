<div class="">
<p>
  6) Have a directive that is dependent of ngModel, that restricts the input to numbers only and auto formats the input into currency, ex: $1,234. The field must change its format as user types. Do not create a $filter for this directive as that does
  not mean the directive itself is doing the format.

  <input type="text" currency-input ng-model="price">
    <p>Ng-model value : {{price}}</p>
</div>
